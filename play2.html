    <p class="stage-direction">Enter AEGEON</P>
        <h4 class="name AEGEON">AEGEON</h4>
        <p class="speech">Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
        And by the doom of death end woes and all.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">Enter DUKE SOLINUS</P>
        <h4 class="name DUKESOLINUS">DUKE SOLINUS</h4>
        <p class="speech">Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
        I am not partial to infringe our laws:
        The enmity and discord which of late
        Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
        To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
        Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
        Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
        Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
        For, since the mortal and intestine jars
        'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
        It hath in solemn synods been decreed
        Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
        To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
        If any born at Ephesus be seen
        At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
        Again: if any Syracusian born
        Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
        His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
        Unless a thousand marks be levied,
        To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
        Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
        Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
        Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">Enter AEGEON</P>
        <h4 class="name AEGEON">AEGEON</h4>
        <p class="speech">Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
        My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</p>
